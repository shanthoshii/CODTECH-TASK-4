# Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on textual data such as reviews or tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The aim is to classify text data into different sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) by training a machine learning model on preprocessed textual input.

## ðŸ“‚ About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of user reviews or social media texts along with sentiment labels. It contains:

- **Text**: Raw review/tweet content.
- **Sentiment**: Label denoting the sentiment (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral).

You may replace the dataset with your own CSV file by uploading it to Google Colab and modifying the file path.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ For data manipulation
- **NumPy** â€“ For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ For model training and evaluation
- **Regular Expressions (re)** â€“ For text cleaning
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** â€“ For text feature extraction

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Steps

1. **Load Dataset**: Read CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove unwanted characters, punctuations, and lowercase the text.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization (optional).
4. **Feature Extraction**: Convert text data into numerical format using TF-IDF.
5. **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
8. **Insights**: Interpret results and understand model performance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights and Findings

- The TF-IDF vectorizer effectively captured important words that contributed to sentiment classification.
- The Logistic Regression model gave a reliable accuracy on the test set, showing it's suitable for basic sentiment tasks.
- Most classification errors were found in neutral reviews, which are often harder to classify.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope

- Implement more advanced NLP models like LSTM, BERT for improved accuracy.
- Add support for multilingual sentiment analysis.
- Perform real-time sentiment classification on live social media feeds using APIs.
- Use Word2Vec or GloVe embeddings for richer text representations.

## âœ… Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic but complete pipeline for text-based sentiment analysis using machine learning. It highlights the importance of preprocessing and vectorization in text classification and serves as a strong foundation for further exploration in NLP.
